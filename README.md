# Joseph Dotfiles

Included here is a couple of the dotfiles I use. I'm pretty simple so they don't contain all that much, just enough to help me feel a tiny bit more productive.
This may be updated from time to time but these are the basics.

### Included files

- .vimrc -> I barely use vim except for truly quick file edits (one liners where I don't want to open a full featured editor) so not much here, but it's what I like. It's mostly based on other templates.

- .zshrc -> Simple zshrc -> Must also install `thefuck`

- mac.sh -> Updates keyboard repeat rate.
